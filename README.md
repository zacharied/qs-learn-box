# qs-learn-box

A little game I made in Rust.

## Instructions

Use the vim keys (h, j, k, l) to move your box. Red boxes come in the edges of
the playfield; you must stop them from hitting your red box. However, when the
blue box around you touches a red obstacle, you gain points.

## Building

`cargo build` should do the trick.
